              Interactivos? is a collaborative laboratory for developing projects. This year, the theme of Interactivos? '16 is Water and Autonomy. Our intention is to study autonomous hydrology systems and encourage cross-disciplinary action between popular, scientific, technical and artistic knowledge to create solutions to water issues through a citizen perspective.
              </p>
              <p>
              To do this, this edition of Interactivos? aims to host projects that propose experiments and solutions for the problems we face in dealing with water, such as scarcity and waste, drinking water for human and animal consumption, and water intended for other uses by different sectors of society: domestic, agricultural, industrial and recreational activities.

            <h3>The Place</h3>
              <p>
              Interactivos? '16 Water and Autonomy will take place in Serrinha do Alambari, which is characterized as an Environment Protection Area, in the municipality of Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is situated on the eastern slopes of the Itatiaia National Park, Serra da Mantiqueira, and west of the road to Visconde de Mauá (RJ-163). This area is unique in how it integrates rural and environmental protection zones. Serrinha has about 1,000 inhabitants and tourism activity. Despite the abundance of water, which is one of the main attributes of the region, the town has very common problems relating to water consumption. During the lab we will further investigate these problems and the solutions that the people have created to solve them.
              </p><p>
	      The Environment Protection Area of the Serrinha do Alambari covers the communities of Serrinha and Capelinha, protecting the upper reaches of the watersheds of the Alambari and Pirapitinga rivers. Its total area corresponds to 4,500 hectares. It is located in the Agulhas Negras region well known for its mountain scenery and beautiful waterfalls of cold and crystalline waters. The Mantiqueira mountain range is important as a source of drinking water, and for the formation of rivers that supply a large number of cities in southeastern Brazil. The streams of Mantiqueira form the river Jaguari, responsible for supplying the northern region of São Paulo; as well as the Paraiba do Sul River, which cuts a densely populated and highly industrialized region in Rio and São Paulo; and Rio Grande, which is part of the largest hydroelectric complex in the country.
              </p><p>
              According to Agenda 21 (UN 1992), the mountains are an important source of water, energy and biological diversity. In addition, they provide key resources - such as minerals, forest and agricultural products - and are a source of recreation. As a major ecosystem representing the complex and interrelated ecology of our planet, mountain environments are essential to the survival of the global ecosystem. However, mountain ecosystems are undergoing rapid change. They are susceptible to accelerated soil erosion, landslides and rapid loss of genetic diversity. With regard to human populations, there is widespread poverty among mountain inhabitants and loss of native knowledge. The result is that most of the mountainous areas of the world are experiencing environmental degradation. As a result, the proper management of mountain resources and socioeconomic development of their communities require immediate action.
              </p><p>
              The mountains also provide key resources for society: 14% of the world population live there; they provide 70% of water resources for domestic, agricultural and industrial consumption; they hold 25% of the biodiversity and vital genetic resources needed for adaptation of agricultural fields and cattle raising; they host almost 60% of the biosphere reserves; and attract 15 to 20% of world tourism (FAO/UN, 2012).
              </p><p>
              The creation and strengthening of knowledge about the ecology and sustainable development of mountain ecosystems, as well as the promotion of integrated watershed development and alternative livelihoods, are some of the goals of Agenda 21.The realization of Interactivos? '16 Water and Autonomy in Serrinha is collaborating with these goals and will make available techniques and technologies for water management from different areas of knowledge.

              The model for this program is based on the methodology developed by Medialab-Prado, art and technology center in Madrid, Spain. Since 2006, Interactivos? Has provided an interactive model of learning that goes beyond the typical hierarchical dynamics between teacher and student. The name refers to a questioning of the idea of interactivity, while promoting collective creation and the use of free tools, in an environment where participants can both learn and teach.

Internationally renowned, the model designed by Medialab-Prado received an honorable mention from Ars Electronica in 2010.

		This residency program is organized by one of the two branches of Nuvem - Rural Art and Technology Center.
		</p><p>
		Inaugurating its 5th year, and with the need to update and reaffirm itself as a collaborative and self-managed project, Nuvem - Rural Art and Technology Center seeks to build new partnerships and coordination formats in order to enable separate autonomous work fronts. The purpose of this organization into separate work fronts is to expand the scope of activities, and carry out new partnerships and collaborations. 
		</p><p>
		Nuvem is a rural center that aims to provide an environment for an interdisciplinary exchange between different fields of knowledge - especially art, science and technology - in order to strengthen a culture of autonomy. One of the many practices of the project is to encourage the adoption of minimal environmental impact technologies while building new economies and working structures. This, in turn, is made possible by combining intuitive techniques with scientific knowledge, thereby enriching research that deals with energy efficiency, food autonomy, proper treatment of waste and minimum consumption practices, while at the same time not overlooking the poetic and aesthetic dimensions present in these different modes of knowledge. The initiative is dedicated to the creation, promotion and distribution of knowledge pertaining to the countryside and in the countryside. All of this is achieved through artistic residency programs, temporary laboratories for collaborative development of projects, meetings, festivals, workshops, workgroups and female leadership activities.
