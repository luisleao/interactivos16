              <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
              <p>
              Interactivos? is a collaborative laboratory for developing projects. This year, the theme of Interactivos? '16 is Water and Autonomy. Our intention is to study autonomous hydrology systems and encourage cross-disciplinary action between popular, scientific, technical and artistic knowledge to create solutions to water issues through a citizen perspective. 
              </p><p>
              To do this, this edition of Interactivos? aims to host projects that propose experiments and solutions for the problems we face in dealing with water, such as scarcity and waste, drinking water for human and animal consumption, and water intended for other uses by different sectors of society: domestic, agricultural, industrial and recreational activities.
              </p><p>
              We are interested in proposals that think the whole water cycle from the sources to the taps, and consider how it passes through different stages of capture, reservoirs, distribution, sanitation, reuse, water quality maintenance, security strategies for disaster relief and prevention of accidents in vulnerable populations.
              </p>

              <p>
              We are also expecting projects that deal with problems inherent in drainage basin regions and their components (watersheds, valleys, sub-basins, springs, discharge areas, and their hydrogeochemical or hydrochemical characteristics), upriver and downriver networks, ebb and flow of water, flooding, riparian vegetation (riparian forest, gallery forests), as well as projects that deal with basic sanitation, virtual water (water taken to produce a good, product or service), water pollution, and other related issues. We will also consider suggestions or solutions to water network stress, water scarcity and water saving techniques, as well as educational and policy-based strategies for its rational use (by human, industrial and agricultural sectors), ideas for better legislation, sustainable management, techniques and technologies for reuse, etc ...
              Drinking water, bathing water, washing water, water to produce, water to play. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The laboratory will welcome proposals from different areas of interest including art and technology, social technology, humanities and sciences, engineering, and others. The goal of Interactive? '16 Water and Autonomy is to create interaction between different areas that complement each other while considering systematic water dynamics (residential, agricultural, industrial contexts) in an environment that promotes the exchange of information and technologies about conscious management and sustainability of water, and provides structure for the practical development of the projects.

                <span class="mdl-typography--font-light mdl-typography--subhead">Five proposals will be selected to be developed during the 15-day period between October 29th and November 12th, at Nuvem - Rural Art and Technology Center. Each proposal will count with the support of up to 5 collaborators, who will also be selected by an open call. The call for collaborators will open after the proposal selection so that people interested in collaborating may choose which project to work on.  Technical and theoretical orientation will be provided for all selected projects, and at the end of the residency each group will have to present a minimum viable product or prototype.

              <h3>RESIDENCY DESCRIPTION</h3>
              <p>
              Nuvem will offer the following to the selected projects: work space, tools, internet connection, shared space for meetings and other gatherings, technical and conceptual advice, financial support for tools and materials, as well as three daily meals, travel fare and accommodation in a shared house. 
              </p><p>
              The proponents must agree to perform the following: be in touch with the selected collaborators before and during the development of the project, present the project at the beginning of the residency, document the project's progress together with the collaborators, share final results.
              </p><p>
              The residency consists in: an initial presentation and discussion of the projects, collaborative lab and work dynamics for the development of the projects, discussion sessions with advisers and invited specialists, and a final presentation of the developed projects. This methodology aims to provide a platform for collective research, production and learning, that stem from the development of the projects.
              </p><p>
              The proposals are developed in multidisciplinary workgroups comprised by the proponent and interested collaborators, with conceptual and technical support of advisers and other assistants.
              </p><p>
              One of the main goals of the program is to foster development, diffusion and open access to processes, knowledge, and collaborative networks. Therefore, we encourage all participants to create proper documentation of the projects, not only during the event but also afterwards. We strongly suggest that all participants publish their results, schematics, design plans and code under free licenses to allow for the distribution of all knowledge created during the event.

              <h3>THE PLACE</h3>
              <p>
              Interactivos? '16 Water and Autonomy will take place in Serrinha do Alambari, which is characterized as an Environment Protection Area, in the municipality of Resende, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is situated on the eastern slopes of the Itatiaia National Park, Serra da Mantiqueira, and west of the road to Visconde de Mauá (RJ-163). This area is unique in how it integrates rural and environmental protection zones. Serrinha has about 1,000 inhabitants and tourism activity. Despite the abundance of water, which is one of the main attributes of the region, the town has very common problems relating to water consumption. During the lab we will further investigate these problems and the solutions that the people have created to solve them.
              </p><p>
              The Environment Protection Area of the Serrinha do Alambari covers the communities of Serrinha and Capelinha, protecting the upper reaches of the watersheds of the Alambari and Pirapitinga rivers. Its total area corresponds to 4,500 hectares. It is located in the Agulhas Negras region well known for its mountain scenery and beautiful waterfalls of cold and crystalline waters. The Mantiqueira mountain range is important as a source of drinking water, and for the formation of rivers that supply a large number of cities in southeastern Brazil. The streams of Mantiqueira form the river Jaguari, responsible for supplying the northern region of São Paulo; as well as the Paraiba do Sul River, which cuts a densely populated and highly industrialized region in Rio and São Paulo; and Rio Grande, which is part of the largest hydroelectric complex in the country.
              </p><p>
              According to Agenda 21 (UN 1992), the mountains are an important source of water, energy and biological diversity. In addition, they provide key resources - such as minerals, forest and agricultural products - and are a source of recreation. As a major ecosystem representing the complex and interrelated ecology of our planet, mountain environments are essential to the survival of the global ecosystem. However, mountain ecosystems are undergoing rapid change. They are susceptible to accelerated soil erosion, landslides and rapid loss of genetic diversity. With regard to human populations, there is widespread poverty among mountain inhabitants and loss of native knowledge. The result is that most of the mountainous areas of the world are experiencing environmental degradation. As a result, the proper management of mountain resources and socioeconomic development of their communities require immediate action.
              </p>


              <p>
              The mountains also provide key resources for society: 14% of the world population live there; they provide 70% of water resources for domestic, agricultural and industrial consumption; they hold 25% of the biodiversity and vital genetic resources needed for adaptation of agricultural fields and cattle raising; they host almost 60% of the biosphere reserves; and attract 15 to 20% of world tourism (FAO/UN, 2012).
              </p><p>
              The creation and strengthening of knowledge about the ecology and sustainable development of mountain ecosystems, as well as the promotion of integrated watershed development and alternative livelihoods, are some of the goals of Agenda 21.

              The model for this program is based on the methodology developed by Medialab-Prado, art and technology center in Madrid, Spain. Since 2006, Interactivos? Has provided an interactive model of learning that goes beyond the typical hierarchical dynamics between teacher and student. The name refers to a questioning of the idea of interactivity, while promoting collective creation and the use of free tools, in an environment where participants can both learn and teach.

              In 2016 Interactivos? Celebrated its 10th anniversary. This format of event has already been used in places like Madri, New York, Mexico City, Lima, Belo Horizonte (Marginalia+Lab in 2010) and Serra da Mantiqueira (Nuvem, 2012 and 2013). Internationally renowned, the model designed by Medialab-Prado received an honorable mention from Ars Electronica in 2010.

Nuvem is a rural center that aims to provide an environment for an interdisciplinary exchange between different fields of knowledge - especially art, science and technology - in order to strengthen a culture of autonomy. One of the many practices of the project is to encourage the adoption of minimal environmental impact technologies while building new economies and working structures. This, in turn, is made possible by combining intuitive techniques with scientific knowledge, thereby enriching research that deals with energy efficiency, food autonomy, proper treatment of waste and minimum consumption practices, while at the same time not overlooking the poetic and aesthetic dimensions present in these different modes of knowledge. The initiative is dedicated to the creation, promotion and distribution of knowledge pertaining to the countryside and in the countryside. All of this is achieved through artistic residency programs, temporary laboratories for collaborative development of projects, meetings, festivals, workshops, workgroups and female leadership activities.
</p><p>
Inaugurating its 5th year, and with the need to update and reaffirm itself as a collaborative and self-managed project, Nuvem - Rural Art and Technology Center seeks to build new partnerships and coordination formats in order to enable separate autonomous work fronts. The purpose of this organization into separate work fronts is to expand the scope of activities, and carry out new partnerships and collaborations. This residency program is organized by one of the two branches of Nuvem - Rural Art and Technology Center.
